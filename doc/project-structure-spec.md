# project structure specification

When we start a new project, the first problem comes to us is: **how to organize our code ?**. Where our `html` files live? And where our UI components live? Things get much harder when it comes to `MPA`, that we have multiple `html` pages and therefore multiple `entry` files, we must share some common logic between these entry files.

So, when I begin this demo project, I have to think about file structures at the very beginning.
